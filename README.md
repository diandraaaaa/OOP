# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Course

This repository contains projects developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course.

## Description

The course focuses on teaching fundamental principles and practices of object-oriented programming using C++. Students learn to design and implement software solutions using object-oriented methodologies, design patterns, and modern programming techniques.

## Projects Overview

- **Fruit Inventory Management System:** Developed a console-based application to manage a fruit store's inventory, implementing features such as adding, deleting, and searching for fruits.
